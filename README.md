## Let's Make Some Memories

This work is based on UpLateGeek PCB design V24.0: https://github.com/UpLateGeek/Let-s-Make-Some-Memories

I included the EDO-2-FPM mod into the original design, but also had to reroute most of the traces to make space for the mod.
When ordering the PCBs using the Gerber files, make sure to select the correct thickness for the PCBs - standard thickness is 1.2mm.

Unfortunately, the schematics do not yet include the changes made to the PCB due to the mod.
